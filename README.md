We chose **React.js** as the main framework for this project for the following reasons:

1. **Reusable Components**: React allows creating modular and reusable components, facilitating code maintenance and evolution.

2. **Optimal Performance**: React's Virtual DOM ensures high performance and a smooth user experience.

3. **Large Ecosystem**: React has a vast community and numerous complementary libraries.

4. **Development Ease**: Create React App provides a preconfigured setup that accelerates project startup.

5. **Single Page Application (SPA)**: React enables creating a modern user experience without page reloads.
